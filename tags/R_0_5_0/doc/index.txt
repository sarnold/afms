AFMS is an "Artefact Management System" to manage some of the artefacts  
appearing in the software development process of a product. These artefacts are
namely

* Features
* Requirements
* Use cases
* Test cases 
* Test suites


With the program afeditor_ the management system provides a GUI to create, edit and 
delete artefacts and to edit relations between artefacts. In addition to the artefacts 
listed above the afeditor_ supports simple text sections and a glossary.
The afeditor_ allows to export artefacts in either HTML or XML format.

The program testrunner_ is used to manually "execute" test cases organized in a test suite
and to log the test results. Automatic execution is supported when scripts are used in test cases.

The AFMS programs are implemented in Python_ using wxPython_ for the graphical user interfaces.
Furthermore the `docutils package <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/>`_ is required.
No other components are required.

Artefacts and other data are stored in SQLite_ databases. SQLite_ (pysqlite) comes with current
Python_ releases.

AFMS is a standalone application, no database servers, web servers or similar are required.
The intended use of AFMS is for small and medium sized projects where only a small number
of people has to edit the artefacts.

AFMS is strongly inspired by the `Open Source Requirements Management System`_ and the
`Ready-to-use Software Engineering Templates`_
