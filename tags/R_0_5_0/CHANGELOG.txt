===============================
AFMS Release 0.5.0 (2008-09-23)
===============================

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Testcase extension: a new text field for a URL to a test script has been 
  added. In testrunner this script could be executed from within the GUI. 
  Test result is set according to the return code of the script. Also in 
  testrunner all or some scripts may be executed in batch mode. 

* Extended settings dialog: 
  configurable stylesheets for XML and HTML export
  and opening the default viewer after report creation

* Drag and drop support for afeditor and testrunner: 
  dropping a artefact file in the tree region opens the file

* Statistics: simple artefact statistics available with menu item 
  File/Statistics

* Recent files (afeditor and testrunner): 
  list of recently opened files is now provided in File menu

* Added table formating to popup menu of multiline text controls.
  This works for HTML and REST renderers
  
* Added Indent/Unindent command to popup menu of multiline text controls.  

* Added a menu item Help/Feedback with links to bug tracker, feature request 
  tracker and so on.

* In error messages dialogs due to Python exceptions the complete tracelog is 
  shown. This will allow better support.


Changes
~~~~~~~
* Toolbar button for glossary entries replaces 'Add' button 
  below the glossary list view 
  
* HTML export now makes XHTML

* XML export format changed

* Improved display in list views for long strings with lots of tabs and newlines

* "Version" field replaced by "Key" field: for features, requirements and 
  testcases the field "Version" has been renamed to "Key". When editing such 
  an artefact the value of the key field could be selected from a drop down 
  list.
  Rationale: some users requested a kind of grouping for artefacts. This could 
  be done by giving same keys to artefacts belonging to the same group.
  Note: in the databes the version field is used to hold the key information.

* More documentation


Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~  
* Conversion from XML archive file to database with afarchivetodb.py now works
  properly.
  Added a final commit statement to avoid an empty usecase table in the database.
  
* Databases with a filename containing non ascii characters (e.g. german 
  umlaut) may now be created and opened without an error message
  (see http://bugs.python.org/issue2127 for details).

* Multiline text strings starting with '.. HTML' followd by a blank line 
  are now rendered as HTML.

Changes
