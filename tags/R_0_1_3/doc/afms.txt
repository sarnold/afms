Introduction
============
AFMS is an "Artefact Management System" to manage some of the artefacts  
appearing in the software development process of a product. These artefacts are
namely

* Features
* Requirements
* Use cases
* Test cases 
* Test suites


With the program *afeditor* the management system provides a GUI to create, edit and 
delete artefacts and to edit relations between artefacts. 
The *afeditor* allows to export artefacts in either HTML or XML format.

The program *testrunner* is used to manually "execute" test cases organized in a test suite
and to log the test results.

The AFMS programs are implemented in Python_ using wxPython_ for the graphical user interfaces.
Furthermore the `docutils package <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/>`_ is required.
No other components are required.

Artefacts and other data are stored in SQLite_ databases. SQLite_ (pysqlite) comes with current
Python_ releases.

AFMS is a standalone application, no database servers, web servers or similar are required.
The intended use of AFMS is for small and medium sized projects where only a small number
of people has to edit the artefacts.

AFMS is strongly inspired by the `Open Source Requirements Management System`_ and the
`Ready-to-use Software Engineering Templates`_

Getting started with afeditor
=============================

Create a new product
--------------------
You may start *afeditor* from the shell calling "afeditor.py". For Microsoft Windows, 
you may run "afeditor.pyw" if you don't like the console.

After starting the program you can create a new "software product". 
From the file menu select "New Product" and select enter the database file name 
for the product in the subsequent dialog.

Afterwards you should edit the product properties by selecting the "Product" item in 
the tree view. Enter a product title and a more or less detailed description and save 
your changes.

In the product description input field you may use either plain text, `HTML markup`_
or  `reStructuredText markup`_.


Add features to the product
---------------------------
Now you can start collecting the features of the software product. Select the 
"New feature" item from the "New" menu or press the corresponding button |new_feature_btn| 
in the toolbar.

In the appearing dialog you have to enter the title of the feature and you may enter the description
of the feature. Again, for the description, you may use plain text, `HTML markup`_
or  `reStructuredText markup`_.

Beside title and description the following attributes of a feature could be defined:

Priority
    Essential | Expected | Desired | Optional.


Status
    Submitted | Approved | Completed

Risk
    Dangerous | 3-Risk | 2-Risk | 1-Risk | Safe

Version
    A version identifier

After saving a unique ID is assigned to the feature.

Along with the feature basic data a changelog is provided. Select the changelog tab 
and enter a change description. This description is mandatory once the status of the 
feature is "submitted". If the status is "completed" you are not allowed to change a feature. 

After you have entered a couple of features try to select the "Feature" item in the tree view
in the left panel. You will see a list with all your features in the right panel. The list can
be sorted by clicking into the column header.



Add requirements and relate them to features
--------------------------------------------
Adding requirements to the product works the same way as adding features.
Select "New requirement" from the "New" menu or press the toolbar button |new_requirement_btn|.
In the subsequent dialog you may enter title, description, priority, status and version of the requirement.
Furthermore the following attributes are available:

Complexity
    Low | Medium | High

Effort
    Months | Weeks | Days | Hours


Assigned
    The name of whom the requirement is assigned to

Category
    Functional | Reliability | Up-time | Safety |
    Security | Performance | Scalability | Maintainability |
    Upgradability | Supportability | Operability |
    Business life-cycle | System hardware | System software |
    API | Data import/export | Other

In the "Rationale" tab of the dialog you could enter the origin and the rationale of the requirement.
The tabs "Attached Testcases" and "Attached Usecase" shows a list with all test cases and use cases.
You may select test cases and use cases belonging to the current requirement.

The tab "Related features" shows a list with the features to which the requirement belongs to.
To edit this list, you have to edit each feature, select the "Attached Requirements" tab and check each
requirement to be attached to the feature.

Another way to attach a new requirement to a feature is to select the feature in the tree view and issue
the "New Requirement" menu command. The new requirement becomes automatically attached to the selected 
feature.


Add use cases and test cases and relate them to requirements
------------------------------------------------------------
Select "New use case" or "New test case" from the "New" menu to create a use case or a test case.
Of course you also can use the corresponding toolbar buttons |new_usecase_btn| or |new_testcase_btn|.

Use cases have the following attributes:

Summary
    A brief description of the use case

ID
    After saving a unique ID is assigned to the use case.

Priority
    Essential | Expected | Desired | Optional.

Use frequency
    Always | Often | Sometimes | Rarely | Once
    
Stakeholders
    Stakeholders for the use case. You may enter stakeholders or select previously 
    entered stakeholders from a list.
    
Actors
    Actors for the use case. You may enter actors or select previously 
    entered actors from a list.
    
Prerequisites
    Prerequisites for the use case

Main Scenario
    Main scenario of the use case
    
Alternative Scenario
    Alternative scenarios to the main scenario
    
Notes
    Notes and hints
    

Test cases have the following attributes:

Title
    A brief description of the test case

ID
    After saving a unique ID is assigned to the test case

Version
    A version identifier
    
Purpose
    Purpose of the test case
    
Prerequisite
    Prerequisite for the test case
    
Testdata:
    Testdate to be used in the test case
    
Steps
    Steps to perform the test case
    
Notes and Questions
    Notes, hints and questions 
    

If you have selected a requirement when issuing the command "New use case" or "New test case"
the new artefact will be attached to the selected requirement.
Another way to do this is to edit the requirement and check the required test cases or use cases 
in the list shown in the tabs "Attached Testcases" or "Attached Usecases".


Create test suites and attach test cases
----------------------------------------
Test suites are simply collections of test cases. Attributes of a test suite are Title, ID, Description,
execution order of test cases and of course a list of test cases.
When creating a new test suite with either menu command "New testsuite" or toolbar button 
|new_testsuite_btn| a list with all test  cases is shown. You may check any test case that should be 
in the test suite.

Test suites are important for the testrunner_ program, because *testrunner* allows 'execution'
of all test cases in a test suite.


Deleting artefacts
------------------
You may delete any artefact using the toolbar button |del_af_btn|, the menu command "Delete artefact"
from the "Edit" menu or simply with the Del key. Actually the artefact is not deleted but goes
to the trash. An artefact could be restored by double clicking it in the corresponding view of the trash.

Intentionally there is now way to empty the trash, so no artefact could get lost.


Export artefacts in HTML or XML format
--------------------------------------
You can export all artefacts of a product into a HTML or XML report file.
XML reports only contains the artefacts. HTML reports contains some additional problem analysis:

* Features with no requirements attached
* Requirements with no test cases attached
* Use cases without related requirements
* Test cases without related requirements
* Test cases not in a test suite 
* Test suites without test cases

To create the report use the menu commands "Export as HTML" or "Export as XML" from the "File" menu.


Import artefacts from another database
--------------------------------------
Importing artefacts is quite easy. After issuing the command "Import" from the "File" menu you can select 
the database file with the artefacts to import. After this a dialog with one tab for each kind of arefact 
is shown. Each tab contains a list with corresponding artefacts and you can check the artefacts to be 
imported.

On top of the dialog there is a checkbox "Select related artefacts automatically". If it is checked
and you check for example a requiremt to be imported, then all test cases and use cases related 
to that requirement are checked too.

Getting started with testrunner
===============================

Overview screenshot
-------------------
.. image:: images/screenshot_tr_overview.png


Create a new test run
---------------------
You may start *testrunner* from the shell calling "testrunner.py". For Microsoft Windows, 
you may run "testrunner.pyw" if you don't like the console.

Select "New test run" from the "File" menu to create a new test run. 
A wizard will guide you through the four required steps:
#. Select the database with the artefacts of the software product
#. Select the test suite which should be run
#. Enter description of the test run (i.e. release information) and the name of the tester
#. Enter the filename to save the test run to


Execute test cases
------------------
To 'execute' a test case you simply have to activate the test case in the list 
i.e. with a double click. A dialog opens where you can enter the test result.


Pausing a test run
------------------
All test results are saved immediately. Thus you can quit the application anytime and resume
test execution later.


Abort test run
--------------
Choose the menu item "Cancel current test run" from the "Test" menu.
After entering the reason for cancelation all pending test cases will be marked as skipped.
and the remark field will show the ´reason for cancelation.


Query information about a test run
----------------------------------
Select menu item "About current test run" from the "Test" menu. This will give information about 
the prduct, the test suite and the test run.


Export test run as HTML or XML
------------------------------
Select "Export as HTML" or "Export as XML" from the "File" menu.
A test report will be saved in the selected format. For HTML output the cascading style sheet
afmsreport.css will be used,


Special features
----------------
If you are using `HTML Markup`_ in one of the attributes of a test case (i.e. in the 'Steps'
field) you may enter a link like ``script://sample.sh``. 
When clicking this link testrunner tries to execute the specified script in a shell.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Markup
======
Most of the multiline edit fields support different markups.
You may use either plain text, HTML markup or reStructuredText markup.


HTML Markup
-----------
Enter the tag <html> in the first line of the description and </html> in the last line.
Between these tags you may use most of the basic HTML tags. 

|example1|

Rendering takes place after closing the dialog. In normal view mode the rendered text 
is shown.

|example2|

.. |EXAMPLE1| image:: images/screenshot_edit_product_html.png
.. |EXAMPLE2| image:: images/screenshot_view_product_html.png
  

reStructuredText markup
-----------------------
Place the directive ".. REST" in the first line of the description. Then you can use 
reStructuredText_ markup.




Acknowledgment
==============

AFMS is implemented in Python_ and uses wxPython_ as GUI Toolkit.
reStructuredText_ is used for rendering on demand.

The database engine is sqlite_.
