AFMS: Short Manual for testrunner
==================================

.. contents::

----

Overview
--------

|testrunner| is a tool to run testcases in a testsuite created with |afeditor|.
Testcases are run either by performing the test steps manually or by executing a test script.
If a testcase has a script you may execute the script in |testrunner|. Output of the script
is captured and the test result is set to "fail" if the return value of the script is 
not 0.
Additionally |testrunner| is able to execute the scripts of all testcases having one in a 
single run. Again, the output of each script is captured and the test result is set according to 
the return value of the script.

Here is a screenshot of the |testrunner| main window.

The left panel gives an overwiew about testcases and the execution status.
In the mid panel the data of the selected testcase is shown. The right panel
contains the result or status of the selected testcase.

Starting |testrunner|
---------------------

You may start |testrunner| from the command line calling "testrunner.py". For Microsoft Windows, 
if you don't like the console, you may run |testrunner| by double clicking the file 
``testrunner.pyw`` in the explorer window. If you have downloaded the Win32 binary release simply
execute ``testrunner.exe``.

When running from command line you may enter several command line options. Type::

    testrunner --help

to see the available options.


Create a new test run
---------------------

Select "New test run" from the "File" menu, press "Ctrl-N" or press the button
|new_product_btn| in the toolbar to create a new test run. 
A wizard will guide you through the four required steps:

#. Select the database with the artefacts of the software product
#. Select the test suite containing the testcases
#. Enter description of the test run (i.e. release information) and the name of the tester
#. Enter the filename to save the test run to

After that a database file is created containing a **copy** of the testsuite and the testcases,
the product information from the artefact database and the description of the test run.
Testcases may now be executed and the test results will be stored in the database.


Execute test cases
------------------

To 'execute' a test case you simply have to activate the test case in the list 
i.e. with a double click. A dialog opens with testcase data (read only) and inputs for 
the test result.

  |screenshot_testrunner_execdialog|
  
You have to select the test result, either "FAIL", "PASS' or "SKIP".
For a failed test you must enter a action, that means what has been done 
in reponse to the failure. A bug ID or bug report URL may be entered here for example.
Any additional information can be saved in the "Remark" field. A time stamp of the test execution
is captured automatically.

If the testcase has a script you can execute it by clicking the label "Script URL".
The output of the script is written to the "Remark" field. If the script returns the value 0 the
test result is set to "PASS", otherwise it is is set to "FAIL".
The dialog does not close after script execution, so you may edit all fields as required.

Execute scripts of all testcases having a script
-------------------------------------------------


Pausing a test run
------------------
All test results are saved immediately. Thus you can quit the application anytime and resume
test execution later.


Abort test run
--------------
Choose the menu item "Cancel current test run" from the "Test" menu.
After entering the reason for cancelation all pending test cases will be marked as skipped.
and the remark field will show the reason for cancelation.


Query information about a test run
----------------------------------
Select menu item "About current test run" from the "Test" menu. This will give information about 
the prduct, the test suite and the test run.


Export test run as HTML or XML
------------------------------
Select "Export as HTML" or "Export as XML" from the "File" menu.
A test report will be saved in the selected format. For HTML output the cascading style sheet
afmsreport.css will be used,


Special features
----------------
If you are using `HTML Markup`_ in one of the attributes of a test case (i.e. in the 'Steps'
field) you may enter a link like ``script://sample.sh``. 
When clicking this link testrunner tries to execute the specified script in a shell.
